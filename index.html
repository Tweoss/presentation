					<h2>Future Letter</h2>
					<p style="text-align:left; text-indent: 1cm;" class="r-fit-text">
						You won't remember this, so to give you the context, this letter is from the final AP Literature
						project. You had to write a letter to yourself for the first day of school. Now, your past self
						would simply like to remind you of your past self's ideals.
					</p>
					<p style="text-align:left; text-indent: 1cm;" class="r-fit-text">
						First, don't make a scene. Try to be unobtrusive, at least for the first week or so. Make
						friends but know that the situation is in no way certain yet.
						Second, try things! Don't be a recluse, there's nothing to gain there. Joining in on the
						<b>inevitable</b> networking is going to be way more exciting than not.
						Third, keep some time for yourself. Don't look at homework or your phone or your computer, and
						just sit and think for a bit everyday.

					<h2>üîî Poetry! üîî</h2>
					<div style="height: 50vh; overflow-y: scroll; white-space: pre-line; text-align: left;">
						I.

						Hear the sledges with the bells‚Äî
						Silver bells!
						What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
						How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
						In the icy air of night!
						While the stars that oversprinkle
						All the heavens, seem to twinkle
						With a crystalline delight;
						Keeping time, time, time,
						In a sort of Runic rhyme,
						To the tintinabulation that so musically wells
						From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
						Bells, bells, bells‚Äî
						From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.

						II.

						Hear the mellow wedding bells,
						Golden bells!
						What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
						Through the balmy air of night
						How they ring out their delight!
						From the molten-golden notes,
						And all in tune,
						What a liquid ditty floats
						To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats
						On the moon!
						Oh, from out the sounding cells,
						What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
						How it swells!
						How it dwells
						On the Future! how it tells
						Of the rapture that impels
						To the swinging and the ringing
						Of the bells, bells, bells,
						Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
						Bells, bells, bells‚Äî
						To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!

						III.

						Hear the loud alarum bells‚Äî
						Brazen bells!
						What tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!
						In the startled ear of night
						How they scream out their affright!
						Too much horrified to speak,
						They can only shriek, shriek,
						Out of tune,
						In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
						In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,
						Leaping higher, higher, higher,
						With a desperate desire,
						And a resolute endeavor
						Now‚Äînow to sit or never,
						By the side of the pale-faced moon.
						Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
						What a tale their terror tells
						Of Despair!
						How they clang, and clash, and roar!
						What a horror they outpour
						On the bosom of the palpitating air!
						Yet the ear it fully knows,
						By the twanging,
						And the clanging,
						How the danger ebbs and flows;
						Yet the ear distinctly tells,
						In the jangling,
						And the wrangling.
						How the danger sinks and swells,
						By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells‚Äî
						Of the bells‚Äî
						Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
						Bells, bells, bells‚Äî
						In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!

						IV.

						Hear the tolling of the bells‚Äî
						Iron bells!
						What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
						In the silence of the night,
						How we shiver with affright
						At the melancholy menace of their tone!
						For every sound that floats
						From the rust within their throats
						Is a groan.
						And the people‚Äîah, the people‚Äî
						They that dwell up in the steeple,
						All alone,
						And who tolling, tolling, tolling,
						In that muffled monotone,
						Feel a glory in so rolling
						On the human heart a stone‚Äî
						They are neither man nor woman‚Äî
						They are neither brute nor human‚Äî
						They are Ghouls:
						And their king it is who tolls;
						And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
						Rolls
						A p√¶an from the bells!
						And his merry bosom swells
						With the p√¶an of the bells!
						And he dances, and he yells;
						Keeping time, time, time,
						In a sort of Runic rhyme,
						To the p√¶an of the bells‚Äî
						Of the bells:
						Keeping time, time, time,
						In a sort of Runic rhyme,
						To the throbbing of the bells‚Äî
						Of the bells, bells, bells‚Äî
						To the sobbing of the bells;
						Keeping time, time, time,
						As he knells, knells, knells,
						In a happy Runic rhyme,
						To the rolling of the bells‚Äî
						Of the bells, bells, bells‚Äî
						To the tolling of the bells,
						Of the bells, bells, bells, bells‚Äî
						Bells, bells, bells‚Äî
						To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.

					<h2>Favorite Book</h2>
					<p>Flowers for Algernon</p>
					<p style="text-align:left; text-indent: 1cm;" class="r-fit-text">
						It's been several years, but I still remember how striking the book was to me. The concept of
						breathtaking ascent is implied
						everywhere in our lives (yes, that includes the American Dream), and the inevitable loss that
						the main
						character goes through is incredibly painful. The novel really is about a compressed life and so
						it has a dense emotional impact.

							target="_blank">APLAC Essay</a></h2>
					<p style="text-align:left; text-indent: 1cm;" class="r-fit-text">
						I'm proud of this essay because I was able to integrate references to APUSH material in the
						context of a prompt I felt was important to myself. Writing the essay with the position that
						rebellion isn't necessary all good felt like I was tempering my own viewpoint, even as I
						struggled against the oh-so oppressive parental forces bearing over juniour me. While the style
						of the essay could have been more refined, I am still happy that I was able to provide examples
						that contradicted the viewpoint expressed in the quote from the prompt.

					Francis enjoys going out occasionally to the wild outdoors of his backyard. In spite of the slowly
					wilting plants of a season past, he does make attempts to keep a few alive. Otherwise, Francis will
					typically be practicing oboe or percussion, browsing Github's latest projects, or doing homework
					(unfortunately all too rare). He will be attending Stanford in the fall.
